Before you deploy the automation solution, you must prepare the ONTAP environment and install and configure Ansible.

== Initial planning considerations

.Basic requirements

You must meet the following basic requirements to use this solution: 

* You must have access to ONTAP software, either on-premises or through an ONTAP simulator.
* You must know how to use ONTAP software.
* You must know how to use Ansible automation software tools.

.Planning considerations

Before deploying this automation solution, you must decide:

* The location where you are going to run the Ansible control node.
* The ONTAP system, either on-premises hardware or an ONTAP simulator. 
* Whether or not you will require customization. 


== Prepare the ONTAP system

Whether you are using an on-premises ONTAP system or Simulate ONTAP, you must prepare the environment before you can deploy the automation solution. 

=== Optionally, install and configure Simulate ONTAP

If you want to deploy this solution through an ONTAP simulator, you must download and run Simulate ONTAP. 

.Before you begin

* You must download and install the VMware hypervisor that you are going to use to run Simulate ONTAP. 
+
** If you have a Windows or Linux OS, use VMware Workstation.
** If you have a Mac OS, use VMware Fusion.
+
NOTE: If you are using a Mac OS, you must have an Intel processor. 

.Steps

Use the following procedure to install two ONTAP simulators in your local environment:

. Download Simulate ONTAP from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/simulate-ontap[NetApp support site^].
+
NOTE: Although you install two ONTAP simulators, you only need to download one copy of the software.

. If it is not already running, start your VMware application.
. Locate the simulator file that was downloaded and right click to open it with the VMware application.
. Set the name of the first ONTAP instance. 
. Wait for the simulator boot up and follow the directions to create a single node cluster.
+
Repeat the steps for the second ONTAP instance.

. Optionally, add a full disk complement.
+
From each cluster, run the following commands: 
[source,cli]
security unlock -username <user_01>
security login password -username <user_01>
set -priv advanced
systemshell local
disk assign -all -node <Cluster-01>-01

=== State of the ONTAP system

You must verify the initial state of the ONTAP system, whether it is on-premises or running through an ONTAP simulator. 

Verify that the following ONTAP system requirements are met: 

* ONTAP is installed and running with no cluster defined yet.
* ONTAP is booted and displaying the IP address to access the cluster.
* The network is reachable.
* You have admin credentials.
* The Message of the Day (MOTD) banner is displayed with the management address.

== Install the required automation software

This section provides information on how to install Ansible and prepare the automation solution for deployment. 

=== Install Ansible

Ansible can be installed on Linux or Windows systems. 

The default communication method that Ansible uses to communicate with an ONTAP cluster is SSH. 

Refer to link:https://netapp.io/2018/10/08/getting-started-with-netapp-and-ansible-install-ansible/[Getting Started with NetApp and Ansible: Install Ansible^] to install Ansible.

NOTE: Ansible must be installed on the control node of the system. 

=== Download and prepare the automation solution

You can use the following steps to download and prepare the automation solution for deployment.

. Download the link:https://console.bluexp.netapp.com/automationCatalog[ONTAP - Day 0/1 & Health Checks^] automation solution through the BlueXP web UI. The solution is packaged as `ONTAP_DAY0_DAY1.zip`.
+
. Extract the zip folder and copy the files to the desired location on the control node within your Ansible environment.

== Initial Ansible framework configuration

Perform the initial configuration of the Ansible framework:

. Navigate to `playbooks/inventory/group_vars/all`.

. Decrypt the `vault.yml` file:
+
`ansible-vault decrypt playbooks/inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml`
+
When prompted for the vault password, enter the following temporary password:
+
`NetApp123!`
+
IMPORTANT: "NetApp123!" is a temporary password to decrypt the `vault.yml` file and the corresponding vault password. After first use, you *must* encrypt the file using your own password. 

. Modify the following Ansible files: 
* `clusters.yml` - Modify the values in this file to suit your environment. 
* `vault.yml` - After decrypting the file, modify the ONTAP cluster, username and password values to suit your environment.
* `cfg.yml` - Set the file path for `log2file` and set `show_request` under `cfg` to `True` to display the `raw_service_request`.
+
The `raw_service_request` variable is displayed in the log files and during execution. 
+
NOTE: Each file listed contains comments with instructions on how to modify them according to your requirements. 

. Re-encrypt the `vault.yml` file: 
+
`ansible-vault encrypt playbooks/inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml`
+
NOTE: You are prompted to choose a new password for the vault upon encryption. 

. Navigate to `playbooks/inventory/hosts` and set a valid Python interpreter.

. Deploy the `framework_test` service:
+
The following command runs the `na_ontap_info` module with a `gather_subset` value of `cluster_identity_info`. This validates that the basic configuration is correct and verifies that you can communicate with the cluster. 
+
[source,cli]
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts site.yml -e cluster_name=<CLUSTER_NAME>
-e logic_operation=framework-test
+
Run the command for each cluster. 
+
If successful, you should see output similar to the following example:
+
----
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************
localhost : ok=12 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=6
The key is ‘rescued=0’ and ‘failed=0’..
